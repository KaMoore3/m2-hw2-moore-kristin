<h2>Looking Forward: Career Goals</h2>
<p>For the past 3 years I've worked at <a href="https://instoneco.com/">Instone</a> as the marketing manager where I'm very lucky to work with a team that includes a motion graphic designer and our own in house video production team. Over the years, I've done everything from running google campaigns, to setting strategy to creating content. But, there's tons more to do. I am currently taking classes to fill in gaps and round out my experiential knowledge. In the future, my goal is to expand my role directing teams, help launch brands and learn best practices to incorporate the latest trends for the best return.</p>
